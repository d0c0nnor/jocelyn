# Jocelyn

Jocelyn is shim that makes it easier to use the Processing core
libraries from Jython.

![](https://github.com/d0c0nnor/jocelyn/raw/master/docs/images/lots_of_circles.png)

The library ships with a version of Processing that is automatically
added to the classpath ( if not already there ) when the module is
imported. The current version of Processing bundled is 1.5.0.
